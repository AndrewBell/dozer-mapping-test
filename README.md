# dozer-mapping-test
An example of Dozer mapping using Deep Property Mapping and String to Date Mapping

## To run

`mvn test`

## Note

Dozer does not recommend injecting custom mapping files in the way shown here. Typically you'll use an IOC framework, like Spring. http://dozer.sourceforge.net/documentation/usage.html
